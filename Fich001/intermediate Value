Create a program that reads three integer values entered for three variables,
namely, n1, n2 and n3 and which then shows on the screen the value
intermediate.
note:
It is not the average that is requested, but the value of the intermediate!
So, for example, given the values: 7, 8 and 6, entered for variables n1, n2
and n3, respectively, the answer is 7 (the value 7 is in the middle of 6 and 8). For your
time, if the values 9, 3 and 5 are entered, for the variables n1, n2 and n3,
respectively, the answer is 5.

//n1=7, n2=8, n3=6  intermediate= 7

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
	    System.out.println("Enter values:");
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n1 = scan.nextInt();
    int n2 = scan.nextInt();
    int n3 = scan.nextInt();
    if (n1< n2){
      System.out.print(n1);
    }else if(n2 < n3){
      System.out.print(n2);
    }else{
      System.out.print(n3);
    }
    //System.out.print(n1 + " " + n2 + " " + n3);
}
}
